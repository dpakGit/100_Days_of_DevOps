### Task : OpenSearch Setup Using Terraform

The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up an Amazon OpenSearch Service domain to store and search their application logs. The domain should have the following specification:

1) The domain name should be xfusion-es.

2) Use Terraform to create the OpenSearch domain. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.


Notes:

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform.

Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

Before submitting the task, ensure that terraform plan returns No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

The OpenSearch domain creation process may take several minutes. Please wait until the domain is fully created before submitting.

### What I Did

```
bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  pwd
/home/bob/terraform

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  ls
README.MD  provider.tf

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  vi main.tf

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  terraform fmt
main.tf
provider.tf

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  terraform init

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  terraform validate
Success! The configuration is valid.


bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  terraform plan


bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  terraform apply -auto-approve

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the
following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
