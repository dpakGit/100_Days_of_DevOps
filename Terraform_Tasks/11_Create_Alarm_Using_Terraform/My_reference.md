### Task Overview

The Nautilus DevOps team wants to set up monitoring in their AWS account. They need to create an alarm that will notify them when the CPU utilization of an EC2 instance exceeds 80%. This alarm will help them detect potential issues with their instance and take action to prevent performance degradation or outages.

What needs to be done

To accomplish this task, we need to create a CloudWatch alarm using Terraform. Here's what the alarm should do:

1. Monitor CPU utilization: The alarm will monitor the CPU utilization of an EC2 instance.
2. Trigger when CPU utilization exceeds 80%: If the CPU utilization exceeds 80%, the alarm will be triggered.
3. Evaluation period: The alarm will evaluate the CPU utilization every 5 minutes.
4. Single evaluation period: The alarm will trigger after a single evaluation period, meaning that if the CPU utilization exceeds 80% for 5 minutes, the alarm will be triggered.

Using Terraform

We'll use Terraform to create the CloudWatch alarm. Terraform is a tool that allows us to define infrastructure as code. We'll create a main.tf file in the /home/bob/terraform directory that will contain the configuration for the CloudWatch alarm.

main.tf file

The main.tf file will contain the Terraform configuration for the CloudWatch alarm. We'll define the following:

1. The AWS provider
2. The CloudWatch alarm resource
3. The metric and threshold for the alarm

Here's an example of what the main.tf file might look like:
```
terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "your-region"
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "nautilus-alarm" {
  alarm_name                = "nautilus-alarm"
  comparison_operator       = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods        = "1"
  metric_name               = "CPUUtilization"
  namespace                 = "AWS/EC2"
  period                    = "300"
  statistic                 = "Average"
  threshold                 = "80"
  alarm_description         = "Alarm when CPU utilization exceeds 80%"
  insufficient_data_actions = []
  alarm_actions             = []
  ok_actions                = []
}
```
Note that you'll need to replace your-region with the actual region where your EC2 instance is running.

Next steps

Once we've created the main.tf file, we can run Terraform to create the CloudWatch alarm. We'll use the following commands:

1. terraform init to initialize the Terraform working directory
2. terraform apply to create the CloudWatch alarm

After running these commands, the CloudWatch alarm will be created, and it will start monitoring the CPU utilization of the EC2 instance. If the CPU utilization exceeds 80% for 5 minutes, the alarm will be triggered.


### What is a CloudWatch alarm?

A CloudWatch alarm is a feature in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to monitor and track specific metrics or events in your AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, or Lambda functions. When a predefined threshold or condition is met, the alarm triggers an action, such as sending a notification or executing an automated remediation.

What is the use of a CloudWatch alarm?

CloudWatch alarms are useful for several purposes:

1. Monitoring and notification: Alarms can notify you when a specific metric or event occurs, allowing you to respond quickly to issues or anomalies.
2. Automated remediation: Alarms can trigger automated actions, such as scaling resources, restarting instances, or executing Lambda functions, to mitigate issues or prevent outages.
3. Cost optimization: Alarms can help you detect and respond to cost-related issues, such as unexpected spikes in usage or billing.
4. Performance optimization: Alarms can help you detect performance issues, such as high CPU utilization or latency, and trigger actions to optimize resource utilization.
5. Security monitoring: Alarms can detect security-related events, such as unauthorized access or suspicious activity, and trigger notifications or automated responses.

Some common use cases for CloudWatch alarms include:

- Monitoring EC2 instance CPU utilization and triggering notifications or automated scaling when utilization exceeds a threshold.
- Detecting errors or exceptions in application logs and triggering notifications or automated remediation.
- Monitoring RDS database performance metrics, such as CPU utilization or disk space usage, and triggering notifications or automated actions.
- Detecting security-related events, such as unauthorized access or suspicious activity, and triggering notifications or automated responses.

By using CloudWatch alarms, you can proactively monitor and manage your AWS resources, detect issues before they become critical, and automate responses to minimize downtime and optimize performance.
