### Task
The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units.

For this task, create an EC2 instance using Terraform with the following requirements:

The name of the instance must be nautilus-ec2.

Use the Amazon Linux ami-0c101f26f147fa7fd to launch this instance.

The Instance type must be t2.micro.

Create a new RSA key named nautilus-kp.

Attach the default (available by default) security group.

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to provision the instance.

Solution:

The error message indicates that Terraform is missing the required providers local and tls. To fix this, you can run terraform init, which will initialize the Terraform working directory and install the necessary providers.

Run the following command:


bash
terraform init


After running terraform init, you should be able to validate your Terraform configuration using:


bash
terraform validate


If you want to specify the required providers explicitly, you can add the following code to your provider.tf file:


terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = ">= 4.0"
    }
    tls = {
      source  = "hashicorp/tls"
      version = ">= 3.0"
    }
    local = {
      source  = "hashicorp/local"
      version = ">= 2.0"
    }
  }
}


Then, run terraform init to install the providers.
