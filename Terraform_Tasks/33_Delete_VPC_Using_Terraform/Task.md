### Task : Delete VPC Using Terraform
The Nautilus DevOps team is strategically planning the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Acknowledging the magnitude of this endeavor, they have chosen to tackle the migration incrementally rather than as a single, massive transition. They created some services in different regions and later found that some of those can be deleted now.

Delete a VPC named datacenter-vpc present in us-east-1 region using Terraform. Make sure to keep the provisioning code, as we might need to provision this instance again later.

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform.

### What I Did
```

/home/bob/terraform

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  ls
README.MD  main.tf  provider.tf  terraform.tfstate

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  cat main.tf ^C

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âœ– cat main.tf

  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"

  tags = {
    Name        = "datacenter-vpc"
  }
}

aws_vpc.this: Refreshing state... [id=vpc-917a69243200d9075]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the
following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_vpc.this will be destroyed
  - resource "aws_vpc" "this" {
