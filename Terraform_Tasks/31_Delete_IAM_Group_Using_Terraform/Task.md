### Task : Delete IAM Group Using Terraform

The Nautilus DevOps team is currently engaged in a cleanup process, focusing on removing unnecessary data and services from their AWS account. As part of the migration process, several resources were created for one-time use only, necessitating a cleanup effort to optimize their AWS environment.

Delete an IAM group named iamgroup_ravi using terraform. Make sure to keep the provisioning code, as we might need to provision this instance again later.

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform.

### What i did
```

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  pwd
/home/bob/terraform

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  ls
README.MD  main.tf  provider.tf  terraform.tfstate


bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âœ– ls
README.MD  main.tf  provider.tf  terraform.tfstate

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âœ– terraform state list
aws_iam_group.this

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  cat main.tf 
resource "aws_iam_group" "this" {
  name = "iamgroup_ravi"
}

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  terraform destroy -target=aws_iam_group.this -auto-approve
aws_iam_group.this: Refreshing state... [id=iamgroup_ravi]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the
following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_iam_group.this will be destroyed
  - resource "aws_iam_group" "this" {
      - arn       = "arn:aws:iam::000000000000:group/iamgroup_ravi" -> null
      - id        = "iamgroup_ravi" -> null
      - name      = "iamgroup_ravi" -> null
      - path      = "/" -> null
      - unique_id = "sn3ix6ndqr6jy71c4e1e" -> null
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.
aws_iam_group.this: Destroying... [id=iamgroup_ravi]
aws_iam_group.this: Destruction complete after 0s
