### Task : Elastic IP Variable Setup Using Terraform
The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. As part of this phased migration approach, they need to allocate an Elastic IP address to support external access for specific workloads.

For this task, create an AWS Elastic IP using Terraform with the following requirement:

The Elastic IP name nautilus-eip should be stored in a variable named KKE_eip. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform.

Note:

1. The configuration values should be stored in a variables.tf file.

2. The Terraform script should be structured with a main.tf file referencing variables.tf.


### What I Did

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  ls

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  vi  variables.tf 

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  vi main.tf

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  terraform validate
Success! The configuration is valid.


bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  terraform apply -auto-approve

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the
following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_eip.example will be created
  + resource "aws_eip" "example" {
      + allocation_id        = (known after apply)
      + arn                  = (known after apply)
      + association_id       = (known after apply)
      + carrier_ip           = (known after apply)
      + customer_owned_ip    = (known after apply)
      + domain               = (known after apply)
      + id                   = (known after apply)

      + network_border_group = (known after apply)
      + network_interface    = (known after apply)
      + private_dns          = (known after apply)
      + private_ip           = (known after apply)
      + ptr_record           = (known after apply)
      + public_dns           = (known after apply)
      + public_ip            = (known after apply)
      + public_ipv4_pool     = (known after apply)
      + tags                 = {
          + "Name" = "nautilus-eip"
        }
      + tags_all             = {
          + "Name" = "nautilus-eip"
        }
      + vpc                  = (known after apply)
    }
