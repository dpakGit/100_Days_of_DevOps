To create a public S3 bucket named devops-s3-13255 in the us-east-1 region using Terraform, you'll need to define three primary resources in your main.tf file:

aws_s3_bucket: This resource creates the S3 bucket itself.

aws_s3_bucket_acl: This resource sets the Access Control List (ACL) for the bucket. To make it publicly accessible, set the acl to public-read.

aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block: This is a crucial step to override the default public access blocks that AWS applies to new buckets. You must set all four public access block settings to false. This allows the public-read ACL to take effect.

Here is the Terraform code to be placed in /home/bob/terraform/main.tf:

Terraform

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "devops_s3" {
  bucket = "devops-s3-13255"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "block_public_access" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.devops_s3.id

  block_public_acls       = false
  block_public_policy     = false
  ignore_public_acls      = false
  restrict_public_buckets = false
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "devops_acl" {
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.block_public_access]

  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.devops_s3.id
  acl    = "public-read"
}
Once the main.tf file is created, navigate to the /home/bob/terraform directory in the terminal and run the following commands:

terraform init: This initializes the working directory and downloads the necessary AWS provider.

terraform apply: This will create the S3 bucket and configure it for public access based on your main.tf file. You will be prompted to confirm the action.

You can learn more about managing AWS S3 buckets with Terraform by watching a video on the topic.

### Task - As part of the data migration process, the Nautilus DevOps team is actively creating several S3 buckets on AWS. They plan to utilize both private and public S3 buckets to store the relevant data. Given the ongoing migration of other infrastructure to AWS, it is logical to consolidate data storage within the AWS environment as well.

Create a public S3 bucket named xfusion-s3-7892 using Terraform.

Ensure the bucket is accessible publicly once created by setting the proper ACL.

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Notes:

Create the resources only in the us-east-1 region.

Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

The name of the S3 bucket should be based on xfusion-s3-7892.

You can use the ACL settings to ensure the bucket is publicly accessible.



Terraform

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "xfusion_s3" {
  bucket = "xfusion-s3-7892"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "block_public_access" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.xfusion_s3.id

  block_public_acls       = false
  block_public_policy     = false
  ignore_public_acls      = false
  restrict_public_buckets = false
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "xfusion_acl" {
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.block_public_access]

  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.xfusion_s3.id
  acl    = "public-read"
}
