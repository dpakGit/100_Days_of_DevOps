### Task : Create Public S3 Bucket Using Terraform

As part of the data migration process, the Nautilus DevOps team is actively creating several S3 buckets on AWS. They plan to utilize both private and public S3 buckets to store the relevant data. Given the ongoing migration of other infrastructure to AWS, it is logical to consolidate data storage within the AWS environment as well.

Create aÂ publicÂ S3 bucketÂ namedÂ xfusion-s3-7892Â using Terraform.

Ensure the bucket is accessible publicly once createdÂ by setting the proper ACL.

The Terraform working directory isÂ /home/bob/terraform. Create theÂ main.tfÂ file (do not create a differentÂ .tfÂ file) to accomplish this task.

Notes:

Create the resources only in theÂ us-east-1Â region.

Right-click under theÂ EXPLORERÂ section inÂ VS CodeÂ and selectÂ Open in Integrated TerminalÂ to launch the terminal.

The name of the S3 bucket should be based onÂ xfusion-s3-7892.

You can use theÂ ACLÂ settings to ensure the bucket is publicly accessible.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the
following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
