his is a common and important warning from recent versions of Terraform and the AWS provider.

The solution you provided is functionally correct for the task (it will upload the file), but you are encountering a warning because of a deprecation in the AWS provider.

⚠️ Deprecation Warning Explanation
The warning: acl is deprecated. Use the aws_s3_bucket_acl resource instead. means that the AWS provider for Terraform is moving towards a model where access control lists (ACLs) should be managed using a separate resource rather than directly within the aws_s3_bucket resource block.

This change encourages the use of the new S3 recommended practice of setting Bucket Ownership Controls and relying on IAM policies for access, but if ACLs are still required, they must be managed distinctly.

🛠️ How to Fix the Warning
To eliminate the warning, you should remove the acl = "private" line from the aws_s3_bucket resource and define the ACL using a new aws_s3_bucket_acl resource, keeping the ACL setting of "private" as required by the existing configuration.

Here is the updated, clean main.tf file:

```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "xfusion-cp-16046"
  # acl = "private"  <-- REMOVED THIS LINE
  
  tags = {
    Name = "xfusion-cp-16046"
  }
}

# ADDED new resource to manage the ACL separately
resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "my_bucket_acl" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.id
  acl    = "private"
}

resource "aws_s3_object" "xfusion_object" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.bucket
  key    = "xfusion.txt"
  source = "/tmp/xfusion.txt"
}
```
By making this change, you address the deprecation warning while ensuring the bucket is still configured as "private," and the primary task (uploading the file) remains correct.
