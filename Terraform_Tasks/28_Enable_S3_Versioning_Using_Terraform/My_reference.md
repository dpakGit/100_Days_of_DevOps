### The concept of keeping Terraform resources separate is a best practice for modularity and maintainability. Instead of defining all configurations within a single, large resource block, you create dedicated resource blocks for each specific function. This approach mirrors how modern cloud services are designed, where different features (like ACLs, versioning, or lifecycle policies) are separate from the core resource itself. This separation makes your code cleaner and easier to manage, as you can add, remove, or modify features without changing the main resource block. It also helps to prevent errors and makes the code more reusable across different projects.

Example
Let's use the S3 bucket example to illustrate this.

The Old, Deprecated Way (Monolithic)
This approach places all configurations inside the main bucket resource.

```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-awesome-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"  # Deprecated
  
  versioning {         # Deprecated
    enabled = true
  }
}
```
This works, but it can get messy. If you want to change the ACL, you have to modify this single resource block, which can introduce errors or make the code less readable.

The New, Recommended Way (Modular)
This approach uses separate resources for each function, linked together by the bucket's ID.

```
# Core S3 bucket resource
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-awesome-bucket-name"
}

# Separate resource for ACL
resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "my_bucket_acl" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.id
  acl    = "private"
}

# Separate resource for Versioning
resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "my_bucket_versioning" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.id
  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}
```
Here, each function has its own resource. The aws_s3_bucket_acl and aws_s3_bucket_versioning resources are linked to the aws_s3_bucket resource via its ID. This structure is more flexible and resilient to future changes.

Data Protection and Recovery for S3 Bucket
This Terraform configuration manages an Amazon S3 bucket, nautilus-s3-24456, with a focus on implementing robust data protection and recovery measures. To ensure a clear and maintainable code structure, we adhere to Terraform's best practices by managing each bucket feature (ACL and versioning) as a separate, dedicated resource. This modular approach allows for independent management of each aspect, preventing configuration conflicts and improving code readability. As a result, the bucket is configured with private access and has versioning enabled, ensuring that multiple versions of objects are retained. This protects against accidental deletions or data corruption by allowing for easy restoration to a previous state.
