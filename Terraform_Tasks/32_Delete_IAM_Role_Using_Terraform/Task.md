aws_iam_role.role: Refreshing state... [id=iamrole_ravi]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the
following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_iam_role.role will be destroyed
  - resource "aws_iam_role" "role" {
      - arn                   = "arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/iamrole_ravi" -> null
      - assume_role_policy    = jsonencode(
            {
              - Statement = [
                  - {
                      - Action    = "sts:AssumeRole"
                      - Effect    = "Allow"

                        }
                    },
                ]
              - Version   = "2012-10-17"
            }
        ) -> null
      - create_date           = "2025-10-08T06:19:13Z" -> null
      - force_detach_policies = false -> null
      - id                    = "iamrole_ravi" -> null
      - managed_policy_arns   = [] -> null
      - max_session_duration  = 3600 -> null
      - name                  = "iamrole_ravi" -> null
      - path                  = "/" -> null
      - tags                  = {
