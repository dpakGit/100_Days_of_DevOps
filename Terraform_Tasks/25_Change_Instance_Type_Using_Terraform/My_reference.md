To change the instance type of the datacenter-ec2 instance from t2.micro to t2.nano using Terraform, follow these steps:

Step 1: Verify Instance Status
Before making any changes, ensure the instance status check is completed. You can check the status in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI.

*Step 2: Update main.tf File*
In your Terraform working directory /home/bob/terraform, update the main.tf file to reflect the new instance type. Find the resource block for the datacenter-ec2 instance and update the instance_type attribute to t2.nano.

Step 3: Apply Terraform Configuration
Run the following commands in your Terraform working directory:

- terraform init (if not already initialized)
- terraform plan to review the changes
- terraform apply to apply the changes

Step 4: Verify Instance State
After applying the changes, verify that the datacenter-ec2 instance is in the running state. You can do this in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI.

Example main.tf update:


terraform
resource "aws_instance" "datacenter-ec2" {
  // ... other attributes ...
  instance_type = "t2.nano"
  // ... other attributes ...
}


By following these steps, you should be able to successfully change the instance type of your datacenter-ec2 instance using Terraform.


To change the instance type from t2.micro to t2.nano for the datacenter-ec2 instance, update the main.tf file as follows:


terraform
# Provision EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0c101f26f147fa7fd"
  instance_type = "t2.nano"
  subnet_id     = ""
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["sg-66282c1cb060deb9a"]
  tags = {
    Name = "datacenter-ec2"
  }
}


After updating the file, navigate to the Terraform working directory /home/bob/terraform and run the following commands:

- terraform plan to review the changes
- terraform apply to apply the changes

Once applied, verify the instance state in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI. Ensure the instance is in the running state after the change.
