### Task : Policy Variable Setup Using Terraform
The Nautilus DevOps team is automating IAM policy creation using Terraform to enhance security and access management. As part of this task, they need to create an IAM policy with specific requirements.

For this task, create an AWS IAM policy using Terraform with the following requirements:

The IAM policy name iampolicy_javed should be stored in a variable named KKE_iampolicy.
Note:

The configuration values should be stored in a variables.tf file.

The Terraform script should be structured with a main.tf file referencing variables.tf.

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform.

### What I Did

```
bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  pwd
/home/bob/terraform

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  ls
README.MD  provider.tf

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  vi variables.tf

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  vi main.tf

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  terraform fmt
provider.tf
variables.tf

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  terraform init

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  terraform validate
Success! The configuration is valid.


bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  terraform apply -auto-approve

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with
the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_iam_policy.iam_policy will be created
  + resource "aws_iam_policy" "iam_policy" {
      + arn              = (known after apply)
      + attachment_count = (known after apply)
      + description      = "IAM policy created using Terraform"
      + id               = (known after apply)
      + name             = "iampolicy_javed"
      + name_prefix      = (known after apply)
      + path             = "/"
      + policy           = jsonencode(
            {
              + Statement = [
                  + {
                      + Action   = [
                          + "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                          + "s3:ListBuckets",
                        ]
                      + Effect   = "Allow"
                      + Resource = "*"
                    },
                ]
              + Version   = "2012-10-17"
            }
        )
      + policy_id        = (known after apply)
      + tags_all         = (known after apply)
    }
