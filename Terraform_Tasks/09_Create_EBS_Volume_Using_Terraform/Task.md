### Task: Create EBS Volume Using Terraform

The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. By breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, the Nautilus DevOps team can systematically progress through each stage, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process.

For this task, create an AWS EBS volume using Terraform with the following requirements:

Name of the volume should be datacenter-volume.

Volume type must be gp3.

Volume size must be 2 GiB.

Ensure the volume is created in us-east-1.


The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Success! The configuration is valid.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the
following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_ebs_volume.datacenter_volume will be created
  + resource "aws_ebs_volume" "datacenter_volume" {
      + arn               = (known after apply)
      + availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
      + encrypted         = (known after apply)
      + final_snapshot    = false
      + id                = (known after apply)
      + iops              = (known after apply)
      + kms_key_id        = (known after apply)
      + size              = 2
      + snapshot_id       = (known after apply)
      + tags              = {
          + "Name" = "datacenter-volume"
        }
      + tags_all          = {
          + "Name" = "datacenter-volume"
        }
      + throughput        = (known after apply)
      + type              = "gp3"
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
