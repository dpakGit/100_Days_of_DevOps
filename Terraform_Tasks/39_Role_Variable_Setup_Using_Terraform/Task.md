### Task.md

The Nautilus DevOps team is automating IAM role creation using Terraform to streamline permissions management. As part of this task, they need to create an IAM role with specific requirements.

For this task, create an AWS IAM role using Terraform with the following requirements:

The IAM role name iamrole_ammar should be stored in a variable named KKE_iamrole.
Note:

1. The configuration values should be stored in a variables.tf file.

2. The Terraform script should be structured with a main.tf file referencing variables.tf.
The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform.

### What I Did

```
bob@iac-server ~/terraform via 💠 default ➜  pwd
/home/bob/terraform

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via 💠 default ➜  ls
README.MD  provider.tf

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via 💠 default ➜  vi variables.tf

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via 💠 default ➜  vi main.tf

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via 💠 default ➜  terraform fmt
provider.tf
variables.tf

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via 💠 default ➜  terraform init
Initializing the backend...

- Installed hashicorp/aws v5.91.0 (signed by HashiCorp)
Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

bob@iac-server ~/terraform via 💠 default ➜  terraform validate
Success! The configuration is valid.


bob@iac-server ~/terraform via 💠 default ➜  terraform apply -auto-approve

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the
following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_iam_role.iam_role will be created
  + resource "aws_iam_role" "iam_role" {
      + arn                   = (known after apply)
      + assume_role_policy    = jsonencode(
            {
              + Statement = [
                  + {
                      + Action    = "sts:AssumeRole"
                      + Effect    = "Allow"
                      + Principal = {
                          + Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com"
                        }
                    },
                ]
              + Version   = "2012-10-17"
            }
        )
      + create_date           = (known after apply)
      + description           = "IAM role created using Terraform"
      + force_detach_policies = false
      + id                    = (known after apply)
      + managed_policy_arns   = (known after apply)
      + max_session_duration  = 3600
      + name                  = "iamrole_ammar"
      + name_prefix           = (known after apply)
      + path                  = "/"
      + tags_all              = (known after apply)
      + unique_id             = (known after apply)

      + inline_policy (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
aws_iam_role.iam_role: Creating...
aws_iam_role.iam_role: Creation complete after 0s [id=iamrole_ammar]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
