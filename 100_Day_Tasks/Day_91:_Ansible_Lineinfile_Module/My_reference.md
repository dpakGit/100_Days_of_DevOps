The playbook looks mostly correct, but there are a few minor issues that can be improved. Here's a revised version:

```
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes

  tasks:
  # Install httpd web server
  - name: Install httpd package
    package:
      name: httpd
      state: present

  # Start and enable httpd service
  - name: Start and enable httpd service
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
      enabled: yes

  # Create initial index.html file with base content
  - name: Add welcome message and initial content to index.html
    blockinfile:
      path: /var/www/html/index.html
      block: |
        Welcome to Nautilus Group!
        This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!
      owner: apache
      group: apache
      mode: '0744'
      create: yes

  # Ensure proper ownership and permissions are set (not necessary in this case, but kept for consistency)
  - name: Ensure correct ownership and permissions for index.html
    file:
      path: /var/www/html/index.html
      owner: apache
      group: apache
      mode: '0744'
```

In the original playbook, the lineinfile module was used to add a line at the top of the file, but this would require two separate tasks to manage the file's content. Instead, I've used the blockinfile module to add both lines of content to the file in a single task. This approach ensures that the file is created with the correct content and ownership.

Also, note that the file module task at the end is not strictly necessary, as the blockinfile module already sets the ownership and permissions. However, I've kept it in the revised playbook for consistency and to ensure that the file's state is correctly managed.

You can run the playbook using the command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml. Make sure to replace inventory with the actual path to your inventory file if it's different.
