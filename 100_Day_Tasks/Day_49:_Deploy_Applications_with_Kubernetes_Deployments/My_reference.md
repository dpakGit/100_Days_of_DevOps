Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a deployment named "httpd" using the httpd:latest image:

Task: Create a Kubernetes deployment named "httpd" that uses the httpd:latest image.

Steps:

1. Access the jump host: You'll need to access the jump host where the kubectl utility is set up to interact with the Kubernetes cluster. You can use SSH to connect to the jump host.
2. Create the deployment: Once you're logged in to the jump host, you can use the kubectl command to create the deployment.

Commands:

1. Create the deployment:


bash

kubectl create deployment httpd --image=httpd:latest


    *   `kubectl create deployment`: This command creates a new deployment in the Kubernetes cluster.
    *   `httpd`: This is the name of the deployment.
    *   `--image=httpd:latest`: This option specifies the Docker image to use for the deployment. In this case, it's the `httpd` image with the `latest` tag.

**What the command does:**

*   The `kubectl create deployment` command creates a new deployment in the Kubernetes cluster.
*   The deployment is named "httpd" and uses the `httpd:latest` image.
*   Kubernetes will pull the `httpd:latest` image from the Docker Hub registry (or a private registry if configured) and create a pod running the `httpd` container.

**Verify the deployment:**

You can verify that the deployment was created successfully by running:

bash
kubectl get deployments


This command will display a list of deployments in the Kubernetes cluster, including the "httpd" deployment.

*Verify the pod:*

You can also verify that the pod is running by running:


bash
kubectl get pods


#### The line "to deploy the application httpd" means that the goal is to use Kubernetes to manage and run the Apache HTTP Server application, which is represented by the Docker image httpd.

In this context:

- httpd refers to the Apache HTTP Server, which is a popular open-source web server software.
- Deploying the application means creating a Kubernetes deployment that manages the lifecycle of the httpd containers, ensuring they are running and accessible as needed.

By deploying the httpd application in Kubernetes, you can:

- Scale the number of instances (replicas) of the web server as needed
- Manage updates and rollbacks of the application
- Provide a stable and reliable way to access the web server

In this specific task, you're creating a Kubernetes deployment named "httpd" that uses the httpd:latest Docker image to run the Apache HTTP Server application.

This command will display a list of pods in the Kubernetes cluster, including the pod running the httpd container.

By following these steps and commands, you'll have created a Kubernetes deployment named "httpd" that uses the httpd:latest image.
