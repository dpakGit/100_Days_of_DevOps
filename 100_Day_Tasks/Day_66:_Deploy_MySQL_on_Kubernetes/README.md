Creating the objects individually is not necessarily a "better" option, but it is a valid and sometimes preferred approach depending on the situation.

Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons of each method:

Pros of a Single YAML File:

Simplicity and Efficiency: You can create all your resources with a single command (kubectl apply -f filename.yaml), which is fast and less prone to errors.

Version Control: Keeping all related resources in one file makes it easier to manage and track changes in a version control system like Git.

Readability: For a small application like this, having all the pieces in one file makes it easy to see the complete picture of your deployment.

Pros of Individual YAML Files:

Modularization: Breaking down the configuration into separate files (e.g., mysql-pv.yaml, mysql-pvc.yaml, mysql-deployment.yaml) makes it easier to manage and modify individual components without affecting the others.

Reusability: You can reuse a single component, like a PersistentVolumeClaim, in a different deployment without copying the entire configuration.

Troubleshooting: If something goes wrong, it can sometimes be easier to debug a specific object in its own file.

For the task at hand, which involves creating a small set of interconnected resources, a single YAML file is perfectly acceptable and often recommended for simplicity. For larger, more complex applications, using separate files is more common. Both approaches are functionally correct.



### Individual yamls

That's an excellent idea. Creating individual YAML files makes the process more modular and easier to understand step-by-step. I'll provide you with each YAML file separately, along with the commands to create each object and a clear explanation of what each step does.

Step 1: Create the PersistentVolume
This file defines the storage volume on the host machine that will be claimed by your MySQL database. We'll use a hostPath for this example, which is a simple way to create a volume for a single node.
PersistentVolume for MySQL
```
# PersistentVolume: mysql-pv
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 250Mi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"

```

To create the PersistentVolume, use the following command:
kubectl apply -f mysql-pv.yaml

Step 2: Create the PersistentVolumeClaim
This file defines a request for storage. Kubernetes will automatically bind this PersistentVolumeClaim to the PersistentVolume we created in the previous step because the storage size matches.
PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL
```
# PersistentVolumeClaim: mysql-pv-claim
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 250Mi
```

To create the PersistentVolumeClaim, use the following command:
kubectl apply -f mysql-pvc.yaml


Step 3: Create the Secrets
We'll create three separate Secret objects to store the root password, user credentials, and database URL. This is a best practice for managing sensitive information.

Secret for MySQL Root Password
```
# Secret: mysql-root-pass
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-root-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  # The value YUIidhb667 encoded in base64.
  password: WVVLdWRoYjY2Nw==
```
Secret for MySQL User Credentials
```
# Secret: mysql-root-pass
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-root-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  # The value YUIidhb667 encoded in base64.
  password: WVVLdWRoYjY2Nw==
```
Secret for MySQL Database URL
```
# Secret: mysql-db-url
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-db-url
type: Opaque
data:
  # The value kodekloud_db6 encoded in base64.
  database: a29kZWtsb3VkX2RiNg==
```

To create all three Secrets, run the following commands:
Create Secrets
```
kubectl apply -f mysql-root-pass.yaml
kubectl apply -f mysql-user-pass.yaml
kubectl apply -f mysql-db-url.yaml
```
Step 4: Create the Deployment 
The Deployment manages the MySQL Pod. This manifest links the Deployment to the PersistentVolumeClaim and the Secrets we created earlier. It will ensure that one Pod is always running.
# # The Deployment YAML file is the centerpiece that ties all the other resources together.

```
# Deployment: mysql-deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:8.0 # Using a specific version for stability.
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-root-pass
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-db-url
              key: database
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-user-pass
              key: username
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-user-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```
To create the Deployment, use the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f mysql-deployment.yaml

```
Step 5: Create the Service
Finally, the Service exposes the MySQL Deployment. This NodePort Service will make the MySQL database accessible from outside the cluster at a specific port on each node.
Service for MySQL
```
# Service: mysql
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
  - name: mysql
    port: 3306
    targetPort: 3306
    nodePort: 30007
  type: NodePort
```
To create the Service, use the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f mysql-service.yaml
```
These steps and files will give you a complete, modular, and functional deployment of a MySQL server.
