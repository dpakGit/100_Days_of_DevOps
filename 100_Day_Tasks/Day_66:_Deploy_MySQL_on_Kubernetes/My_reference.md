### Here's a step-by-step guide to accomplish the task:

Step 1: Create a PersistentVolume (PV)

- Create a PV named mysql-pv with a capacity of 250Mi.
- Set other parameters as per your preference, such as access mode (e.g., ReadWriteOnce) and persistent volume reclaim policy (e.g., Retain).

Step 2: Create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)

- Create a PVC named mysql-pv-claim that requests 250Mi of storage from the mysql-pv PV.
- Set other parameters as per your preference, such as access mode (e.g., ReadWriteOnce).

Step 3: Create a Deployment

- Create a deployment named mysql-deployment that uses a MySQL image (e.g., mysql:latest).
- Mount the PersistentVolume at the mount path /var/lib/mysql.

Step 4: Create a NodePort Service

- Create a NodePort type service named mysql that exposes the MySQL deployment on port 30007.

Step 5: Create Secrets

- Create three Secrets:
    1. mysql-root-pass with a key-value pair where the key is password and the value is YUIidhb667.
    2. mysql-user-pass with two key-value pairs:
        - Key: username, Value: kodekloud_top
        - Key: password, Value: YchZHRcLkL
    3. mysql-db-url with a key-value pair where the key is database and the value is kodekloud_db4.

Step 6: Define Environment Variables

- Define four Environment variables within the container:
    1. MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: pick value from mysql-root-pass Secret, key password.
    2. MYSQL_DATABASE: pick value from mysql-db-url Secret, key database.
    3. MYSQL_USER: pick value from mysql-user-pass Secret, key username.
    4. MYSQL_PASSWORD: pick value from mysql-user-pass Secret, key password.

By following these steps, you'll have a fully deployed MySQL server on your Kubernetes cluster with the specified components.


### [25-Sep-25 11:41 AM] Meta AI: There could be several reasons why kubectl get secrets is not outputting the Secrets:

1. Namespace: Make sure you're in the correct namespace. If your Secrets are created in a specific namespace, you'll need to specify that namespace when running kubectl get secrets. You can use the -n flag to specify the namespace, like this:

bash
kubectl get secrets -n <namespace-name>

If you're not sure which namespace your Secrets are in, you can try running:

bash
kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces

2. Secret name: Double-check that the Secret names match what you're expecting. If you've created Secrets with different names, they won't show up when you run kubectl get secrets.
3. Creation: Verify that the Secrets have been created successfully. You can check the output of the kubectl apply command to see if there were any errors.
4. Permissions: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to view Secrets in your cluster. If you're running kubectl as a user with limited permissions, you might not be able to see the Secrets.

To troubleshoot further, you can try:

- Running kubectl get secrets -o yaml to see the Secrets in YAML format.
- Checking the Kubernetes dashboard or logs to see if there are any errors related to Secret creation.
- Verifying that the Secrets are being created in the correct namespace and with the correct names.

If none of these suggestions help, feel free to provide more details about your environment and the issue you're experiencing!
[25-Sep-25 11:43 AM] Meta AI: The kubectl get secrets command doesn't output the values of Secrets by default for security reasons. Secrets are sensitive data, and Kubernetes doesn't want to expose them in plain text.

When you run kubectl get secrets, you'll see the metadata about the Secrets, such as their names, types, and ages, but not the actual values.

To view the values of a Secret, you can use the following command:

bash
kubectl get secret <secret-name> -o jsonpath='{.data}' | base64 --decode

This command will output the values of the Secret in plain text.

For example, to view the value of the mysql-root-pass Secret:

bash
kubectl get secret mysql-root-pass -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode

This will output the password value of the mysql-root-pass Secret.

Keep in mind that you should handle Secrets securely and avoid exposing them in plain text whenever possible.

If you want to view all the Secrets in a more readable format, you can use:

bash
kubectl get secrets -o json | jq '.items[] | .metadata.name + ": " + (.data | to_entries[] | .key + ": " + (.value | @base64d))'

This will output all the Secrets with their keys and decoded values.

### In the above task, Secrets are used to store sensitive data, such as passwords and database URLs. Here's a breakdown of the Secrets and their uses:

1. mysql-root-pass: This Secret stores the root password for the MySQL database. It's used to authenticate the root user and grant access to the database.
2. mysql-user-pass: This Secret stores the password for a specific MySQL user (not the root user). It's used to authenticate this user and grant access to the database.
3. mysql-db-url: This Secret is expected to store the database URL or name, however in some cases it might be used for a full connection string or specific database configuration however in the context provided it likely just stores the database name.

Using Secrets for this sensitive data provides several benefits:

- Security: Secrets are stored encrypted and are not visible in plain text, reducing the risk of sensitive data being exposed.
- Flexibility: Secrets can be easily updated or rotated without modifying the Deployment or application code.
- Reusability: Secrets can be reused across multiple Deployments or applications, making it easier to manage sensitive data.

In the Deployment YAML file, these Secrets are referenced as environment variables, allowing the MySQL container to access the sensitive data:

env:
- name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: mysql-root-pass
      key: password
- name: MYSQL_USER
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: mysql-user-pass
      key: username
- name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: mysql-user-pass
      key: password
- name: MYSQL_DATABASE
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: mysql-db-url
      key: database

By using Secrets, you can keep sensitive data separate from your application code and configuration, making it easier to manage and secure your Kubernetes deployments!
