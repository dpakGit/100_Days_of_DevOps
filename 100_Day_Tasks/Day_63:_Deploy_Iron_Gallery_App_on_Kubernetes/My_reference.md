In summary, the task creates a namespace, two deployments (Iron Gallery and Iron DB), and two services to access these deployments. The output is a fully functional Iron Gallery app with a database, deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.


### Here are the steps, commands, and YAML files to accomplish the task:

Step 1: Create a namespace

Create a YAML file named namespace.yaml with the following content:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: iron-namespace-devops

Apply the YAML file to create the namespace:

bash
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml

Step 2: Create deployments

Create two YAML files, one for each deployment.

iron-gallery-deployment.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: iron-gallery-deployment-devops
  namespace: iron-namespace-devops
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: iron-gallery
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: iron-gallery
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: iron-gallery-container-devops
        image: kodekloud/irongallery:2.0
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 50m
            memory: 100Mi
        volumeMounts:
        - name: config
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html/data
        - name: images
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html/uploads
      volumes:
      - name: config
        emptyDir: {}
      - name: images
        emptyDir: {}

iron-db-deployment.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: iron-db-deployment-devops
  namespace: iron-namespace-devops
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      db: mariadb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        db: mariadb
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: iron-db-container-devops
        image: kodekloud/irondb:2.0
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: database_apache
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: "P@ssw0rd"
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          value: "P@ssw0rd123"
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: "devops"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: db
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: db
        emptyDir: {}

Apply the YAML files to create the deployments:

bash
kubectl apply -f iron-gallery-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f iron-db-deployment.yaml

Step 3: Create services

Create two YAML files, one for each service.

iron-db-service.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: iron-db-service-devops
  namespace: iron-namespace-devops
spec:
  selector:
    db: mariadb
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 3306
    targetPort: 3306
  type: ClusterIP

iron-gallery-service.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: iron-gallery-service-devops
  namespace: iron-namespace-devops
spec:
  selector:
    run: iron-gallery
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 32678
  type: NodePort

Apply the YAML files to create the services:

bash
kubectl apply -f iron-db-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f iron-gallery-service.yaml

That's it! You've successfully created the namespace, deployments, and services for the Iron Gallery app.

You can verify the resources by running:

bash
kubectl get namespace
kubectl get deployments -n iron-namespace-devops
kubectl get pods -n iron-namespace-devops
kubectl get svc -n iron-namespace-devops


### [22-Sep-25 9:05 AM] Meta AI: Let's break down each of these:

*1. Labels: run: iron-gallery*

- Purpose: Labels are key-value pairs attached to objects (like Pods or Deployments) that help identify and organize them.
- Use case: In this case, the label run: iron-gallery is attached to the Pods created by the Deployment. This label can be used to:
    - Identify and filter Pods belonging to the iron-gallery application.
    - Select Pods for a Service or other resources.
    - Monitor and manage Pods based on their labels.

2. Replicas count: 1

- Purpose: The replicas count specifies the number of identical Pods that should be running at any given time.
- Use case: In this case, setting replicas: 1 means that only one Pod will be created and managed by the Deployment. This is useful for:
    - Ensuring a single instance of an application is running.
    - Testing or development environments where only one instance is needed.
    - Applications that don't require scaling or high availability.

*3. Selector's matchLabels: run: iron-gallery*

- Purpose: The matchLabels field in a Deployment's selector section specifies the labels that the Deployment should use to select Pods to manage.
- Use case: In this case, the matchLabels field is set to run: iron-gallery, which means the Deployment will:
    - Select Pods with the label run: iron-gallery.
    - Manage and scale these Pods based on the Deployment's configuration.
    - Ensure that the number of Pods with this label matches the specified replicas count.

The relationship between these three is:

- The Deployment creates Pods with the label run: iron-gallery.
- The Deployment's selector section uses matchLabels to select Pods with the same label (run: iron-gallery).
- The Deployment ensures that the number of Pods with this label is equal to the specified replicas count (1 in this case).

By using these fields together, you can create a Deployment that manages a specific number of Pods with a particular label, making it easier to manage and scale your applications.
[22-Sep-25 9:06 AM] Meta AI: Let's break down the differences between these three:

*1. Labels: run: iron-gallery*

- This is a general statement about labels, but without context, it's unclear what object these labels are being applied to.

*2. Selector's matchLabels: run: iron-gallery*

- This specifies the labels that a Deployment (or other controller) uses to select Pods to manage.
- The Deployment will look for Pods with the label run: iron-gallery and manage them.

*3. Template labels: run: iron-gallery under metadata*

- This specifies the labels that will be applied to the Pods created by a Deployment.
- The template section of a Deployment defines the Pod template, and the metadata section within that defines the labels that will be applied to the Pods.

The relationship between these three is:

- The template section defines the labels that will be applied to the Pods created by the Deployment (run: iron-gallery).
- The selector section specifies that the Deployment should manage Pods with the label run: iron-gallery.
- By matching the labels in the template section with the matchLabels in the selector section, the Deployment can properly manage the Pods it creates.

In other words:

- The Deployment creates Pods with the label run: iron-gallery (defined in the template section).
- The Deployment then selects these Pods based on the matchLabels (run: iron-gallery) and manages them.

If the labels in the template section don't match the matchLabels in the selector section, the Deployment won't be able to manage the Pods it creates, which can lead to issues. Therefore, it's essential to ensure that these labels match.

Here's an example:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: iron-gallery
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: iron-gallery  # Selector's matchLabels
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: iron-gallery  # Template labels
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: iron-gallery
        image: kodekloud/irongallery:2.0

In this example, the matchLabels in the selector section matches the labels defined in the template section, ensuring that the Deployment can properly manage the Pods it creates.
[22-Sep-25 9:09 AM] Meta AI: Let's break down the use of run: iron-gallery in these two places:

1. selector.matchLabels: run: iron-gallery

- This specifies the label that the Deployment uses to select existing Pods to manage.
- The Deployment will look for Pods with the label run: iron-gallery and manage them.
- Think of this as the Deployment's way of saying, "I want to manage Pods that have this specific label."

2. template.metadata.labels: run: iron-gallery

- This specifies the label that will be applied to the Pods created by the Deployment.
- When the Deployment creates new Pods, it will automatically apply the label run: iron-gallery to them.
- Think of this as the Deployment's way of saying, "When I create new Pods, I want them to have this specific label."

The relationship between these two is crucial:

- The Deployment creates Pods with the label run: iron-gallery (defined in the template section).
- The Deployment then selects these Pods based on the matchLabels (run: iron-gallery) and manages them.

By using the same label (run: iron-gallery) in both places, the Deployment can:

- Create Pods with a specific label.
- Automatically select and manage those Pods based on that label.

This ensures that the Deployment can properly manage the Pods it creates and maintains the desired number of replicas (in this case, 1).

If the labels didn't match, the Deployment wouldn't be able to select the Pods it creates, and things wouldn't work as expected.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: iron-gallery  # Deployment selects Pods with this label
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: iron-gallery  # Pods created with this label

In this example, the Deployment creates Pods with the label run: iron-gallery and then selects those Pods based on the same label, ensuring that it can manage them properly.
[22-Sep-25 9:18 AM] Meta AI: The error message indicates that the files iron-db-service.yaml and iron-gallery-service.yaml don't exist in the current directory.

To fix this, you need to create these files with the correct YAML configuration for the services. Here's an example of what these files might look like:

iron-db-service.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: iron-db-service-nautilus
  namespace: iron-namespace-nautilus
spec:
  selector:
    db: mariadb
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 3306
    targetPort: 3306
  type: ClusterIP


iron-gallery-service.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: iron-gallery-service-nautilus
  namespace: iron-namespace-nautilus
spec:
  selector:
    run: iron-gallery
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 32678
  type: NodePort


Once you've created these files, you can run the kubectl apply commands again:

bash
kubectl apply -f iron-db-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f iron-gallery-service.yaml

Make sure you're running these commands from the directory where the YAML files are located. If the files are in a different directory, you'll need to specify the full path to the files.

what is the difference between matchLabels: and labels: ?



spec.selector.matchLabels and spec.template.metadata.labels are two crucial fields in a Kubernetes Deployment that work together to manage Pods.

spec.selector.matchLabels
This field defines the selector for the Deployment. It's used to identify which Pods the Deployment should manage. The Deployment will only manage Pods that have all the labels specified in this field. It's how the Deployment "finds" and "adopts" the correct Pods.

spec.template.metadata.labels
This field defines the labels for the Pods that will be created by this Deployment. Any new Pods created by the Deployment's Pod template will automatically have these labels.

The key is that the spec.template.metadata.labels must match the spec.selector.matchLabels. This ensures that the Pods created by the Deployment are correctly selected and managed by it. If they don't match, the Deployment won't be able to find its own Pods, and the replica count won't be fulfilled.






can you give a use case of it and elaborately define it ?


The Difference Explained with a Use Case
spec.selector.matchLabels acts as a query that a Kubernetes Deployment uses to find its own Pods.
spec.template.metadata.labels acts as a labeler that a Deployment applies to every new Pod it creates.

In simple terms, the selector says, "I will manage any Pods that have the label run: iron-gallery," while the template says, "Any Pods I create will have the label run: iron-gallery."

Use Case: Rolling Updates 🔄
Imagine you have a Deployment managing three Pods of your iron-gallery app, all with the label run: iron-gallery. You want to update the app to a new image, say kodekloud/irongallery:3.0.

You update the spec.template.spec.containers.image in your Deployment YAML to the new version.

The Deployment controller sees this change.

It creates a new Pod with the updated image (3.0). This new Pod's metadata.labels are set to run: iron-gallery, matching the Deployment's selector.

The Deployment's selector immediately "finds" this new Pod and adds it to the group of managed Pods.

At the same time, the Deployment begins terminating one of the old Pods (running image 2.0).

The old Pod is shut down, but because its labels (run: iron-gallery) still match the selector, the Deployment knows it's the one it's supposed to be managing.

This process continues until all old Pods are replaced by new Pods, all while the selector continues to ensure that the Deployment is only managing Pods with the correct run: iron-gallery label. This guarantees a smooth, zero-downtime rolling update.






so if template is colour: yellow , and if a pod goes down then the new pod that the deployment will create will have the selector as colour: yellow ?


If spec.template.metadata.labels is set to color: yellow, then yes, any new Pod the Deployment creates will have the label color: yellow.

However, the Deployment's selector (spec.selector.matchLabels) must also be set to color: yellow for it to manage those Pods.

Field	Purpose
spec.selector.matchLabels	The query the Deployment uses to find and manage Pods. It must match the labels on the Pods it wants to control.
spec.template.metadata.labels	The labels the Deployment puts on any new Pods it creates.

Export to Sheets
So, if a Pod with color: yellow goes down, the Deployment will create a new one with the same label to meet its replica count, and because the new Pod's label matches the Deployment's selector, it will be correctly managed.






so the following "spec.template.metadata.labels" is used to manage , create , delete etc the pod as any pod matches this label any operation can be done on it ?


No, that's not quite right. The spec.selector.matchLabels is what a Deployment uses to find and manage its Pods for operations like scaling, updating, or deleting.

The spec.template.metadata.labels is simply a blueprint for the labels that will be applied to any new Pods created by the Deployment. It ensures the new Pods have the correct labels so that the selector can find and manage them.

Think of it this way:

The selector is the manager looking for a specific ID badge.

The template labels are the ID badge maker that puts the right ID on every new employee.

The manager only works with employees who have the correct ID, and the ID maker ensures all new employees get that ID. Without the correct ID on the new Pods, the manager wouldn't be able to find and manage them.






so can we say metadata creates the level on every new pod created and selector selects or finds this label created by metadata to identify the pod ?


Yes, that's an excellent way to put it.

The spec.template.metadata.labels acts as a blueprint for the labels on every new Pod the Deployment creates.

The spec.selector.matchLabels is the search query the Deployment uses to find and manage any Pods that have those specific labels.

The two fields must match for the Deployment to correctly identify and control its own Pods.






so if i want to get a pod with label: yellow with the command kubectl get pod -l ,this is using which lable labels or matchlabels ?


kubectl get pod -l uses the metadata.labels that are actually on the Pods.

The -l flag is a label selector that queries the labels of the Kubernetes objects themselves. The spec.selector.matchLabels field is part of a Deployment or Service's configuration; it's a rule for selecting Pods, not a label that exists on the Pod.

When you run kubectl get pod -l color=yellow, you are asking the Kubernetes API server to return all Pods that have the label color with the value yellow in their metadata.labels section.






is there any command which uses matchlabels ?



Show thinking
Yes, you can see the matchLabels of a Deployment or Service using kubectl. However, since matchLabels is part of the object's definition, you can't filter resources by matchLabels directly.

To view the matchLabels for a Deployment:

View the full YAML: This is the most reliable way to see all fields, including the spec.selector.matchLabels.

Bash

kubectl get deployment <deployment-name> -o yaml
Use describe: The kubectl describe command provides a summary that often includes the Selector line.

Bash

kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>
In the output, look for the Selector: field, which will show the matchLabels used by the deployment to find Pods.






what are the other kubernetes objects where labels and match labels are used ?


Besides Deployments, ReplicaSets and Services also use labels and selectors.

ReplicaSet
A ReplicaSet is a lower-level controller that ensures a specified number of Pod replicas are running at all times. It uses selector.matchLabels to find and manage Pods and a template.metadata.labels to label the Pods it creates. A Deployment actually manages a ReplicaSet, which in turn manages the Pods.


Service
A Service uses a spec.selector to find a group of Pods to expose as a network service. It doesn't create Pods, so it only uses the selector to identify which Pods to route traffic to. This is how a Service links to the Pods created by a Deployment or ReplicaSet.








matchlabels or labels which one can have a set of key/value pair ?


Both labels and matchLabels can have a set of key-value pairs.

labels: This field is a map of key-value pairs (map[string]string) that you attach directly to an object's metadata. You can use multiple labels on a single object to give it different identifying attributes. For example, a pod can have app: frontend and env: production.



matchLabels: This field is also a map of key-value pairs used by a controller's selector. It's used as a filter or a query to find objects with matching labels. A Deployment's matchLabels specifies the exact set of labels (app: myapp, version: v1) that a Pod must have to be managed by that Deployment.
