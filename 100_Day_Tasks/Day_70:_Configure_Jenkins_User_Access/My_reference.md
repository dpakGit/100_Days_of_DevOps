Let's get started with configuring user access for the development team in Jenkins.

Step 1: Access Jenkins UI and Login

- Click the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI.
- Login with username admin and password Adm!n321.

Step 2: Create a New Jenkins User

- Create a new Jenkins user named jim with the password YchZHRcLkL and full name Jim.

Step 3: Configure Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy

- Utilize the Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy to assign overall read permission to the jim user.

Step 4: Remove Anonymous User Permissions

- Remove all permissions for Anonymous users (if any), ensuring the admin user retains overall Administer permissions.

Step 5: Grant Read Permissions to Jim User for Existing Job

- For the existing job, grant the jim user only read permissions, disregarding other permissions such as Agent, SCM, etc.

Additional Notes

- If needed, install plugins and restart the Jenkins service. After plugin installation, select Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running.
- After restarting the Jenkins service, wait for the Jenkins login page to reappear before proceeding.
- Capture screenshots of your configuration for review purposes. Consider using screen recording software like (link unavailable) for documentation and sharing.



Here are the steps to configure Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy and assign overall read permission to the jim user:

Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Go to Jenkins Dashboard: Navigate to the Jenkins dashboard.
2. Click on Manage Jenkins: Click on Manage Jenkins on the left-hand side menu.
3. Configure Global Security: Click on Configure Global Security.
4. Authorization: In the Authorization section, select Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy.
5. Add User: Click on Add User and enter jim in the text box.
6. Assign Permissions: In the matrix, find the Overall section and check the box for Read permission for the jim user.
7. Save: Click Save to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you've successfully configured the Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy and assigned overall read permission to the jim user.


In that case, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to Jenkins Dashboard: Navigate to the Jenkins dashboard.
2. Click on Manage Jenkins: Click on Manage Jenkins on the left-hand side menu.
3. Security: Click on Security (or the equivalent section that contains security settings).
4. Authorization: Look for the Authorization section.
5. Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy: Select Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy (if it's not already selected).
6. Add User: Click on Add User and enter jim in the text box.
7. Assign Permissions: In the matrix, find the Overall section and check the box for Read permission for the jim user.
8. Save: Click Save to apply the changes.

If you're still having trouble finding the right section, you can try searching for "authorization" or "security" in the Jenkins documentation or online forums for more specific guidance.


No, you should follow these steps as the admin user, not the jim user. As the admin user, you have the necessary permissions to configure security settings and assign permissions to other users, including jim.

Log in as the admin user (with username admin and password Adm!n321) and then follow the steps to configure the Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy and assign overall read permission to the jim user.


To see the Jenkins version on the UI:

1. Log in to your Jenkins instance.
2. Click on Manage Jenkins on the left-hand side menu.
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the page.
4. The Jenkins version will be displayed at the bottom of the page, typically in the footer.

Look for text that says something like:

"Jenkins ver. X.XXX"

This will show you the version of Jenkins you're currently running.

To confirm that the jim user has been assigned read permission:

1. Log in to Jenkins as the admin user.
2. Click on Manage Jenkins on the left-hand side menu.
3. Click on Security (or the equivalent section that contains security settings).
4. Look for the Authorization section.
5. Check the matrix or table that shows user permissions.
6. Find the jim user in the list and verify that they have Overall Read permission checked.

Alternatively, you can also test the permission by:

1. Logging out of Jenkins.
2. Logging back in as the jim user.
3. Verifying that jim can view the Jenkins dashboard and jobs, but cannot make any changes.

If jim can view the dashboard and jobs without being able to edit or modify anything, it confirms that they have read permission.

Additional Steps

- If prompted to install plugins, install them and restart the Jenkins service.
- After restarting the Jenkins service, wait for the login page to reappear before proceeding.
- Capture screenshots of your configuration for review purposes. Consider using screen recording software like (link unavailable) for documentation and sharing.

By following these steps, you should be able to configure user access for the development team in Jenkins and grant read permissions to the Anita user.


If you couldn't find the Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy in the authorization box, it's possible that:

1. Plugin not installed: The Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy might require a specific plugin to be installed. Check if the Matrix Authorization Strategy Plugin is installed in your Jenkins instance. You can install it by going to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.
2. Different authorization strategy: Your Jenkins instance might be using a different authorization strategy. Check if there's another option that allows you to assign permissions to users or groups.
3. Configuration issue: There might be a configuration issue or a bug in your Jenkins instance. Try checking the Jenkins logs or seeking help from the Jenkins community.

To troubleshoot, you can try:

1. Checking the Jenkins documentation for the specific version you're using.
2. Searching online for similar issues or solutions.
3. Reaching out to the Jenkins community or support forums.

If you're still having trouble, feel free to provide more details about your Jenkins instance and the issue you're facing, and I'll do my best to help!


In the context of Jenkins, the Anonymous user refers to unauthenticated users who access Jenkins without logging in. In other words, anyone who visits the Jenkins website without providing credentials is considered an Anonymous user.

In the Authorization section, you're looking for a setting that controls permissions for Anonymous users. This setting determines what actions anonymous users can perform on your Jenkins instance.

For example, you might see options like:

- Anonymous with permissions such as Read, Build, or Administer.
- You can configure these permissions to control what anonymous users can do on your Jenkins instance.

In your case, the instruction is to Remove all permissions for Anonymous users, which means you should uncheck any permissions that are currently assigned to Anonymous users. This will ensure that only authenticated users (like admin and anita) have access to Jenkins and can perform actions based on their assigned permissions.

Does that clarify things?


It sounds like you had to add Anita to the job's permission matrix manually.

To confirm, you:

1. Clicked on the job and then Configure.
2. Enabled project-based security.
3. Added Anita to the permission matrix (since she wasn't listed).
4. Checked the box for Read permission for Anita.
5. Ensured no other permissions were checked for Anita.
6. Clicked Save to apply the changes.

By doing this, you've successfully granted read permissions to Anita for the existing job. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
