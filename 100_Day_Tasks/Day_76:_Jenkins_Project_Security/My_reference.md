The two options you're looking at are related to Jenkins' authorization and security settings. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

1. Enable project-based security (Inheritance Strategy: Inherit permissions from parent ACL)

- This option allows you to configure permissions for a specific project or job in Jenkins.
- When you select "Inherit permissions from parent ACL", the project will inherit permissions from its parent folder or the global security settings if it's a top-level project.
- You can then add or override specific permissions for users or groups on this project.

2. Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy

- This is a more granular authorization strategy that allows you to define permissions for specific users or groups on a project-by-project basis.
- With this strategy, you can assign different permissions to different users or groups for each project, such as:
    - Overall: Administer, Read
    - Agent: Configure, Connect, etc.
    - Job: Build, Cancel, Configure, etc.
    - Run: Delete, Update
    - View: Read
    - SCM: Tag, etc.

Key differences:

- Inheritance: The first option inherits permissions from the parent ACL, whereas the second option allows you to define permissions from scratch for each project.
- Granularity: The Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy provides more granular control over permissions, allowing you to assign specific permissions to users or groups for each project.
- Flexibility: The Matrix Authorization Strategy offers more flexibility in managing permissions, but it can also be more complex to configure and manage.

Choose the first option if you want to inherit permissions from the parent ACL and only need to make minor adjustments for a specific project. Choose the second option if you need more fine-grained control over permissions for each project.

[08-Oct-25 11:01 AM] Meta AI: When using "Enable project-based security" with the "Inherit permissions from parent ACL" strategy, the permissions you define are additional to the inherited permissions. This means that the user will have the inherited permissions plus the specific permissions you grant.

In contrast, when using "Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy", you're defining the complete set of permissions for a user or group. If you don't grant a specific permission, the user won't have it.

In your case, if you granted "Read" permission under "Enable project-based security" with inheritance, the user would inherit the necessary overall permissions and have read access to the project.

However, with "Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy", you need to explicitly grant the Overall: Read permission to allow the user to access Jenkins and view the project's existence. Without it, the user might not be able to see the project or access Jenkins at all.

Think of it like this:

- Inheritance strategy: "You have the parent's permissions, plus these additional permissions."
- Matrix Authorization Strategy: "You only have the permissions I explicitly grant you."

So, in the Matrix Authorization Strategy, you need to grant the Overall: Read permission to allow the user to access Jenkins and then grant specific permissions for the project.

If we have given over all Read permission to a user A and the same user is given the Read permission for a job-1 then can the user access another job job-1 with those set of permissions

If you have given:

1. Overall: Read permission to User A: This allows User A to access Jenkins and view the Jenkins dashboard, but it doesn't grant access to specific jobs by default.
2. Read permission for Job-1 to User A: This allows User A to view Job-1's configuration and its build history.

In this scenario, User A cannot access other jobs (like Job-2) unless they have been explicitly granted permission to do so.

The permissions are job-specific, so User A can only view Job-1 and not other jobs unless they have been granted Read permission for those jobs as well.

To summarize:

- ##  Overall: Read permission allows User A to access Jenkins and view the dashboard.
- ##  Read permission for Job-1 allows User A to view Job-1's details.

User A will not be able to access other jobs without explicit permissions.
