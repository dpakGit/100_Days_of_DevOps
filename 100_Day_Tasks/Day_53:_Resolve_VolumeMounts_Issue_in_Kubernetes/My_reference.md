-  Verify that the /var/www/html directory is correctly mounted in the Nginx container and contains the necessary files (e.g., index.php).

- shared-files: An emptyDir volume that's shared between the two containers.


- To resolve the issue with the Nginx and PHP-FPM setup on the Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

Step 1: Check Pod Status

Run kubectl get pods to check the status of the nginx-phpfpm pod. If it's not running, check the logs for errors using kubectl logs nginx-phpfpm.

Step 2: Verify ConfigMap

Check if the nginx-config ConfigMap is correctly configured and applied to the pod. Run kubectl describe configmap nginx-config to view its configuration.

Step 3: Investigate Nginx Configuration

Check the Nginx configuration file mounted from the ConfigMap. Ensure it's correctly set up to proxy requests to PHP-FPM. You can do this by running kubectl exec -it nginx-phpfpm -c nginx-container -- cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.

Step 4: Fix Configuration Issues

If you find any configuration issues, update the ConfigMap with the correct settings. For example, ensure the fastcgi_pass directive points to the correct PHP-FPM service.

Step 5: Update Pod Configuration

If necessary, update the pod's configuration to reflect changes in the ConfigMap. You might need to delete and recreate the pod for changes to take effect.

Step 6: Copy index.php File

Once the pod is running correctly, copy the /home/thor/index.php file from the jump host to the Nginx container's document root using:

bash
kubectl cp /home/thor/index.php nginx-phpfpm:/var/www/html/ --container=nginx-container

Step 7: Verify Website Access

After copying the file, access the website using the Website button on the top bar to ensure everything is working correctly.

Some potential issues and solutions to consider ¹ ²:
- Nginx and PHP-FPM container communication: Ensure both containers are in the same pod and can communicate with each other.
- ConfigMap volume mounting: Verify that the ConfigMap is correctly mounted as a volume in the Nginx container.
- SCRIPT_FILENAME setting: Ensure the SCRIPT_FILENAME fastcgi_param is set correctly in the Nginx configuration to point to the PHP file location.

The logs you're seeing are from the php-fpm-container container within the nginx-phpfpm pod. These logs indicate that PHP-FPM is running and ready to handle connections.

However, you might also want to check the logs for the nginx-container container to see if there are any issues with Nginx. You can do this by specifying the container name in the kubectl logs command:


bash
kubectl logs nginx-phpfpm -c nginx-container


This will show you the logs from the nginx-container container, which can help you diagnose any issues with Nginx, such as configuration errors or problems serving files.

If you want to view the logs from both containers simultaneously, you can use the -f flag to follow the logs and see updates in real-time:


bash
kubectl logs nginx-phpfpm -f --all-containers


This command will display logs from all containers within the nginx-phpfpm pod and continue to stream new log entries as they are generated.
