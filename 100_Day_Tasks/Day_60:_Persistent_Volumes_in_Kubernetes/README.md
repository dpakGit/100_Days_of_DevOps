### "storageClassName:"

 - Under the spec section of pv.yaml and pvc.yaml what is "storageClassName: manual"

 pv.yaml
 
  ```
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 4Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: /mnt/security
```


# pvc.yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-datacenter
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: manual
```

 In Kubernetes, ```a StorageClass``` is a way to define the type of storage that a Persistent Volume (PV) provides. It's like a label that describes the characteristics of the storage, such as its performance, availability, and durability.

In the pv.yaml and pvc.yaml files you provided, storageClassName: manual is used to specify that the PV and PVC are manually provisioned.

*What does manual mean?*

When storageClassName is set to manual, it means that the PV is not dynamically provisioned by a storage class. Instead, the PV is manually created and managed by an administrator.

In this case, the manual storage class is not a real storage class that provides any specific storage characteristics. It's more like a placeholder to indicate that the PV is manually provisioned.

*Why use manual?*

Using manual as the storage class name allows you to create a PV and PVC that are not tied to a specific storage class. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to use existing storage infrastructure or manually manage your storage resources.

How does it work?

When you create a PVC with storageClassName: manual, Kubernetes will look for a PV with the same storageClassName that has enough capacity to satisfy the PVC's request. If a matching PV is found, the PVC will be bound to that PV.

In your case, the PV (pv-datacenter) has a capacity of 4Gi, and the PVC (pvc-datacenter) requests 1Gi of storage. Since the PV has enough capacity, the PVC will be bound to the PV, and the pod can use the storage provided by the PV.

Dynamic provisioning

If you were using a dynamic storage provisioner, you wouldn't need to manually create a PV. Instead, you would create a PVC with a specific storage class name, and the provisioner would automatically create a PV with the requested storage characteristics.

For example, if you had a storage class named fast-storage, you could create a PVC like this:
``
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-fast
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: fast-storage

The fast-storage storage class would then dynamically provision a PV with the requested storage characteristics.
