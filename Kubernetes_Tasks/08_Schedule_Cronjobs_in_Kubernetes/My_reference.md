To see the output of the command executed by the CronJob, you can check the logs of the pod that was created by the job. Here's how you can do it:

1. Get the pods created by the job:


bash
kubectl get pods


2. Look for the pod name that corresponds to the job created by the CronJob. It should be something like datacenter-xxxxx.

3. Check the logs of the pod:


bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>


Replace <pod-name> with the actual name of the pod.

You should see the output of the command echo Welcome to xfusioncorp!, which is:


Welcome to xfusioncorp!


Note that the pod will be terminated after the job is completed, so you might need to check the logs quickly. If the pod is already terminated, you can use the --previous flag to check the logs of the previous container:


bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous


Alternatively, you can also use the kubectl logs command with the job selector:


bash
kubectl logs job/<job-name>


However, since the job name might not be straightforward to determine, using the pod name is usually easier.



### It seems like the CronJob hasn't created a pod yet because the schedule hasn't triggered yet. CronJobs in Kubernetes create pods based on the specified schedule.

If you want to verify that the CronJob is working without waiting for the schedule, you can manually create a Job from the CronJob:


bash
kubectl create job --from-cronjob=datacenter manual-job


Then, you can check the pods and logs:


bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs manual-job-xxxxx


Replace manual-job-xxxxx with the actual pod name.

This way, you can verify that the CronJob is configured correctly and the command is executed as expected.
